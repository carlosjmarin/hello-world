First of many entries to github

My weapon of choice is Eclipse, and Java is the arena I am most comfortable in, but I am young and ambitious so no language is beyond my scope. I am currently training my python, R, and C++ skills, so that I will be effective in almost any situation.

Pursuing the unending quest to bring the singularity to fruition in a positive way. Also, I love the feeling of solving long and complex puzzles and that sweet sweet result at the end. Its my equivalent to scaling El Capitan or mountain biking down Mt Fuji, there's just nothing like it.
